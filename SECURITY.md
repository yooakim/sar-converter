# Security Policy

## Vulnerability Status

### Current Status: 🚀 **ZERO Production Vulnerabilities!**

✅ **Production dependencies**: 0 vulnerabilities  
⚠️ **Development dependencies**: 5 moderate vulnerabilities (development-only)

### Major Security Upgrade Completed

**Migrated from Create React App to Vite:**
- **Before**: 9 vulnerabilities (3 high, 6 moderate) in 1,510 packages
- **After**: 5 vulnerabilities (moderate, dev-only) in 195 packages  
- **Production**: 0 vulnerabilities in production dependencies
- **Packages reduced**: 85% fewer dependencies (1,510 → 195)

### Current Development Issues

- **esbuild** vulnerabilities (development server only)
  - Only affects local development environment (`npm start`)
  - Does not impact production builds (`npm run build`)
  - Azure deployment uses production build only

### Why This Is Now Much Safer

1. **Modern Tooling**: Replaced react-scripts with Vite (actively maintained)
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: 85% fewer packages = smaller attack surface
3. **Production Clean**: Zero vulnerabilities in production dependencies
4. **Development Isolated**: Dev vulnerabilities don't affect deployed app

### Performance Improvements

- **Build Size**: 49.62 kB gzipped (comparable to previous)
- **Build Speed**: Significantly faster with Vite
- **Hot Reload**: Nearly instant updates during development
- **Modern ES Modules**: Better browser compatibility
